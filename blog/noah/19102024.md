# Welcome to my first ever blog post.
In this blog post I would like to talk more about what I plan to do with Secisit and Blastcast.

## What do I plan to do with Secisit?
I plan to make Secisit a technology business who makes software and hardware. 

I'm planning on making:

- An email service.
- Digital Media Store.

## What do I plan to do with Blastcast?
Now here's where I have more ideas.

I plan to make Blastcast a television business who is a broadcaster and makes their own shows.

I would like to do:

- Build my own television studio.
- Get a permit to broadcast from [Ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/).
- Make television shows.
- _Throw parties in the parking lot_ (that's a joke by the way).
