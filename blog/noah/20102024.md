# Closing Sweepy after 4 years.
My name's Noah and I'm the CEO of Secisit and obviously, I founded Sweepy back in 2020. 

Sweepy has been through a lot, it's seen huge milestones in my own life and it's own life. Sweepy was more than just a Discord bot, Sweepy was a community, with services like Poll Network where you could all come together and give each other polls. They were the good days, but these good days have to end at some point, and they're ending now sadly. 

The last thing I wanted to do with Sweepy is close it down, but Secisit can no longer afford to keep it going.

## Do I have plans to launch something like Sweepy in the future?
Most likely not.

## I want to find out more about this.
