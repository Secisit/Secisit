# Important information for all Sweepy users.
Secisit have decided to stop the Sweepy servers after 4 years of Sweepy being around.

## Why did we make this decision?
It wasn't a good idea to keep it going because we were only losing money on it. This isn't a decision that Secisit has taken lightly, Sweepy has been in our family since late 2020 and the last thing we ever wanted to see happen to it is for it to shut down.

## What products are affected in this shutdown?
The following products are affected:

-   Sweepy for Discord
-   Sweepy for WhatsApp
-   Sweepy Memes
-   Sweepy Poll Network
-   Hey Sweepy
-   SweepyOS
-   pcOS/textOS versions that have Sweepy built in.

## What will happen to the Hey Sweepy website.
The Hey Sweepy website will stop working and will be re-directing to this website.

## What will happen to all of my Sweepy data?
It will be removed from the servers.

# Information
Sweepy is a brand of Secisit and the Sweepy Group.

(C) 2024 - Secisit and it's associates. 

RIP Sweepy.
